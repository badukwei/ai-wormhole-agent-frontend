# Wormhole Query AI  

This project leverages **Wormhole Query** to allow users to input queries, which are then processed by an AI agent to fetch relevant on-chain data. Currently, the project runs with **mock data** for testing.  

## Features  
- Users can input natural language queries  
- AI agent parses the query and formats it for blockchain data retrieval  
- Utilizes **Wormhole Query** to fetch on-chain data (mock data for now)  

## Local Development & Setup  

### 1. Install dependencies  
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start the development server  
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open in browser  
The app runs on `http://localhost:3000` by default. Open it in your browser to explore the functionality.  

## Future Improvements  
- Integrate with live **Wormhole Query** data  
- Enhance AI query parsing  
- Improve UI/UX for better user experience
